         <h2>About me..</h2>
         <p>Since I was a child, I always loved to understand how things work, to investigate and try new ways of doing the same. My game was to disassemble and reassemble my toys. I am thankful to my family and teachers for encouraging me to learn and for having followed my curiosity.</p>

         <h3>Discovering Software's meaning</h3>
         <p>Once my family got our first computer, I used to look over my brother's shoulder while he played or did his homework. When I was 9 years old, I went to an institute to learn, by playing, to use the basic tools of Microsoft Office and Macromedia's design and animation software. At only 13 years old (and without code understanding), I created my first webpage, hosted on Geocities, designed in Fireworks, and implemented with Dreamweaver. It was maintained using Frontpage to include a lot of GIFs (many of those created by me in Flash), pieces of code, and third-party scripts, such as a fancy cursor, hover effects, and elements that blew my young mind.</p>

         <h2>My very first project</h3>
         <p>In Argentina, it's common for girls to have a very special celebration for their 15th birthday. So, at every birthday I was invited to, I took photos and created albums that I uploaded to a website. As a result, I started getting invited to unknown girls' birthdays. I tried to collaborate with a couple of friends to cover more birthdays, but we needed cameras and a car to travel at night (and we were very young), so the project came to a halt.</p>

         <h2>Learning about Science & Electronics</h3>
         <p>I went to university to study Electronics Engineering, there I learned a lot about Math and Physics and also discovered Computer Science and learnt programming in C/C++ language. I enjoyed doing Hardware projects for Digital Electronics such as an alarm clock (with format MM:SS) which triggers any 220V device, created with a pulse setted in once per second with secuencial digital counters and 8 bits display. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q3P-jaWgepw">(Link to demo video)</a> But I didn't finish my Electronics Engineering studies. I switched to studying System Analysis, where I focused more on software stuff.</p>

         <h2>As a tech savvy entrepreneur</h3>
         <p>My first paid job involved fixing computers for people I knew. During my teenage years, I provided support to a sound engineer at live shows. Additionally, I freelanced in video-related tasks such as digitizing VHS tapes, video editing, and creating videos from collected pictures. As a volunteer, I designed marketing campaigns for events and developed AR Instagram filters.</p>

         <h3>Working professionally in IT</h3>
         <p>At the beginning of 2020's pandemic, I decided to start searching for a job in the IT field. So, I've started <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/">CS50 Web Programming course</a> and to work as QA into a web app project. During these years, Iâ€™ve completed the course and started the final project to complete my universitary studies on System Analysis.</p>
         <p>My first job was as Quality Assurance, I put in practice how to work into an Agile methodology, to work into different virtual environments, repo management and version control. In this project, we were almost 150 people from all around the world working under the DevSecOps model. My daily work as part of Scrum Testing was to be on charge of reviewing and testing new Features and User Stories, find bugs and also to write and execute test cases. Due to my performance, after 1+ year working, I've got a promotion.</p>
         <p>Since November 2023, I've started a new role as Data Engineering where I'm working with Google Cloud Platform services as bucket storages, composer and cloud functions.</p>
